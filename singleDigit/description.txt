The goal of this Kata is to reduce the passed integer to a single digit (if not already) by converting the number to binary, taking the sum of the binary digits, and if that sum is not a single digit then repeat the process.

If the passed integer is already a single digit there is no need to reduce
n will be an integer such that 0 < n < 10⁹
